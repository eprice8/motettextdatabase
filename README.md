# motettextdatabase
The Motet Text Database is an online reference tool to make the texts of thirteenth-century motets digitally accessible, searchable, and discoverable. The project models knowledge about medieval works by combining methods of historical musicology and processes of understanding ontologies of digital objects.
In this GitHub repository, you will find files associated with the Motet Text Database. As the site develops, TEI versions of the motet texts will be made available.
